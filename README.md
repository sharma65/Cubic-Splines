Project during the Spring 2017 semester at Rutgers University, for the Numerical Analysis class.
Given our n data points, this interpolates the data through the cubic spline and "not-a-knot" cubic spline algorithms, which essentially stitch together cubic functions.
NCS, NNCS are original with TestNCS, TestNNCS supplied.
